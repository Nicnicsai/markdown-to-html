<p><i>It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. 
 I want to know what you ache for – and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing. It doesn’t interest me how old you are. 
 I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool – for love – for your dreams – for the adventure of being alive.</i></p>

<h5> After seeing Jaws when I was small, I got scared of water in general, even of the water in the toilet. I had to watch a video about how this movie was made to fix this. </h5>

<h6> TL;DR: I was afraid of going to the toilet after watching Jaws, when I was small. </h6>
